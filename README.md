**Memory Compaction:**

Memory compaction happens during garbage collection.
If a collection finds many unreachable objects, it compacts memory.
Compaction rearranges objects to minimize fragmentation.
Large objects (e.g., arrays) are allocated separately to avoid fragmentation.

**Large Object Heap (LOH) Compaction:**

LOH contains large objects (e.g., arrays > 85 KB).
Compacting LOH can be expensive.
You can manually compact LOH using GCLargeObjectHeapCompactionMode.CompactOnce.
However, it‚Äôs typically done automatically during full garbage collections.

**Logical Address:**

It is a virtual address generated by the CPU while a program is running. It is referred to as a virtual address because it does not exist physically. Using this address, the CPU access the actual address or physical address inside the memory, and data is fetched from there.

**Physical Address**

Physical Address is the actual address of the data inside the memory. The logical address is a virtual address and the program needs physical memory for its execution. The user never deals with the Physical Address. The user program generates the logical address and is mapped to the physical address by the Memory Management Unit(MMU).

The hardware device called Memory Management Unit (MMU) is used for mapping this logical address to the physical address. The set of all logical addresses generated by the CPU for a program is called the logical address space.

### Memory Management in C# and .NET:
Memory management is crucial for efficient software development. In C# and .NET, automatic memory management is provided by the Common Language Runtime (CLR).

When a garbage collection is triggered, the garbage collector reclaims the memory that's occupied by dead objects. The reclaiming process compacts live objects so that they're moved together, and the dead space is removed, thereby making the heap smaller. This process ensures that objects that are allocated together stay together on the managed heap to preserve their locality.

### States: ###

**Free:**	The block of memory has no references to it and is available for allocation.

**Reserved**	The block of memory is available for your use and can't be used for any other allocation request. However, you can't store data to this memory block until it's committed.

**Committed**	The block of memory is assigned to physical storage.


**Benefits:**

1. Frees developers from having to manually release memory.
2. Allocates objects on the managed heap efficiently.
3. Reclaims objects that are no longer being used, clears their memory, and keeps the memory available for future allocations. Managed objects automatically get clean content to start with, so their constructors don't have to initialize every data field.
4. Provides memory safety by making sure that an object can't use for itself the memory allocated for another object.


<p align="center">

</p>

**Garbage Collector (GC):**

1. The CLR‚Äôs garbage collector automatically manages memory for managed applications.
2. Developers don‚Äôt need to manually allocate or free memory; the GC handles it.
3. This eliminates common issues like memory leaks or accessing freed memory.

**Managed Heap:**

1. When a process starts, the runtime reserves a contiguous region called the ‚Äúmanaged heap.‚Äù
2. All reference types (objects) are allocated on this heap.
3. Objects are allocated consecutively, and their memory is contiguous.

**Allocating Memory:**

1. When you create a reference type (e.g., an object), memory is allocated on the managed heap.
2. The GC maintains a pointer to the next available memory location.
3. New objects are allocated sequentially, as long as address space is available.

**Releasing Memory:**

1. The GC determines when to perform a collection based on allocations.
2. It examines the application‚Äôs roots (e.g., static fields, local variables) to find reachable objects.
3. Unreachable objects are released, freeing memory.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Allocate memory for an object
        MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
        
        // Use myObject...
        
        // No need to explicitly free memory; GC handles it
    }
}

class MyClass
{
    // Class definition
}
```


### Generations: ###

The garbage collector (GC) divides memory into three generations: 0, 1, and 2.
Each generation represents different object lifetimes.

**Generation 0 (Youngest):**

Contains short-lived objects (e.g., temporary variables).
Frequent garbage collection occurs here.
Objects that survive move to generation 1.

**Generation 1 (Buffer):**

Serves as a buffer between short-lived and long-lived objects.
Promotes objects with longer lifetimes.
If not enough memory, GC collects gen 1 and then gen 2.

**Generation 2 (Long-Lived):**

Holds long-lived objects (e.g., server data).
Surviving objects remain here.
Large objects (LOH) are also collected here.


### Performance considerations: ### 

**Workstation GC:**

Used for client apps (e.g., desktop apps).
Runs on the user thread that triggered it.
Competes with other threads for CPU time.
Always used on single-CPU computers.

**Server GC:**
For server apps (high throughput).
Multiple dedicated threads (high priority).
Each logical CPU has a heap.
Faster than workstation GC.
Can be resource-intensive.

**Differences:**

Background workstation garbage collection uses one dedicated background garbage collection thread, whereas background server garbage collection uses multiple threads. Typically, there's a dedicated thread for each logical processor.

Unlike the workstation background garbage collection thread, the background server GC threads do not time out.

</p>

### Generations and Heap Segments:
Imagine the managed heap as a storage area for objects in a .NET application. 

Objects are grouped into different generations: 0, 1, and 2.

The heap is divided into segments: Small Object Heap (SOH) and Large Object Heap (LOH).

If an object is small (less than 85,000 bytes), it goes to the SOH segment.

If an object is large (85,000 bytes or more), it goes to the LOH segment.

### Object Promotion: ### 
Objects survive garbage collection (GC) cycles.

Survivors from generation 0 become generation 1 objects.

Survivors from generation 1 become generation 2 objects.

Objects in the oldest generation (gen2) remain there.

### Large Object Heap (LOH): ###

The LOH stores large objects.

Compacting the LOH (rearranging objects) is expensive.

Instead, the GC sweeps the LOH, creating a free list of dead objects.

These dead objects can be reused for new large object allocations

## Types:
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/ref-struct
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/
- https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/15i6m8b/very_confused_about_structs/
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples#code-try-3

### Value Types:

1. Derived from System.ValueType, which itself derives from System.Object.
2. Special behavior in the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
3. Variables directly contain their values.

**Structure Type:**

A structure type (or struct type) is a value type that encapsulates data and related functionality.
You use the struct keyword to define a structure type.
Structure types have value semantics, meaning they contain an instance of the type directly.

**Default Behavior:**

Variable values of structure types are copied on assignment, method arguments, and method return.
Use structure types for small data-centric types with little or no behavior.

**Immutable Structs:**
Declare a readonly struct to make it immutable.
All data members must be read-only or init-only.

**Readonly Instance Members:**
Mark instance members as readonly if they don‚Äôt modify the struct‚Äôs state.
Readonly members can call non-readonly members but can‚Äôt assign to instance fields.

**Enumeration Type:** 

1. An enum type is a value type defined by named constants.
2. Enum members have an associated constant value (by default, of type int).
3. You can specify any integral numeric type as the underlying type.


**Nullable value type** - T? represents all values of its underlying value type T and an additional null value

**const** - keyword to declare a constant field or a local constant

**Built-in types:**

1. bool - System.Boolean
2. byte	- System.Byte
3. sbyte - System.SByte
4. char	- System.Char
5. decimal - System.Decimal
6. double	- System.Double
7. float	- System.Single
8. int	- System.Int32
9. uint	- System.UInt32
10. nint	- System.IntPtr
11. nuint	- System.UIntPtr
12. long	- System.Int64
13. ulong	- System.UInt64
14. short	- System.Int16
15. ushort - System.UInt16


### Reference Types:

1. class
2. interface
3. delegate
4. record

**Built-in types:**

1. object	- System.Object
2. string	- System.String
3. dynamic - System.Object

### Tuples vs System.Tuple:
The tuples feature provides concise syntax to group multiple data elements in a lightweight data structure. 

```charp
(double, int) t1 = (4.5, 3);
Console.WriteLine($"Tuple with elements {t1.Item1} and {t1.Item2}.");
// Output:
// Tuple with elements 4.5 and 3.

(double Sum, int Count) t2 = (4.5, 3);
Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {t2.Count} elements is {t2.Sum}.");
// Output:
// Sum of 3 elements is 4.5.
```

C# tuples, which are backed by System.ValueTuple types, are different from tuples that are represented by System.Tuple types. The main differences are as follows:

1. System.ValueTuple types are value types. System.Tuple types are reference types.
2. System.ValueTuple types are mutable. System.Tuple types are immutable.
3. Data members of System.ValueTuple types are fields. Data members of System.Tuple types are properties.

**Tuples as out parameters**

```csharp
var limitsLookup = new Dictionary<int, (int Min, int Max)>()
{
    [2] = (4, 10),
    [4] = (10, 20),
    [6] = (0, 23)
};

if (limitsLookup.TryGetValue(4, out (int Min, int Max) limits))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Found limits: min is {limits.Min}, max is {limits.Max}");
}
// Output:
// Found limits: min is 10, max is 20
```

### Dynamic Type:
The dynamic type in C# was introduced in version 4.0 (.NET 4.5). It allows you to bypass compile-time type checking and resolve the type at runtime. Here are the key points about dynamic 

**Definition**: A dynamic type variable is defined using the dynamic keyword.

**Type Checking**: Unlike other static types, the compiler doesn‚Äôt perform type checking on dynamic variables during compilation.

**Runtime Resolution**: The actual type of a dynamic variable is determined at runtime.

**Operations**: You can perform any operation on a dynamic element without the need to know its exact type.

**Errors**: If the code isn‚Äôt valid, errors surface at runtime rather than compile time.

```csharp
class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod1(int i) { /* ... */ }
    public void ExampleMethod2(string str) { /* ... */ }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    ExampleClass ec = new ExampleClass();

    // Compiler error (if ExampleMethod1 has only one parameter)
    // ec.ExampleMethod1(10, 4);

    dynamic dynamic_ec = new ExampleClass();

    // No compiler error (but causes a runtime exception)
    dynamic_ec.ExampleMethod1(10, 4);

    // These calls also don't cause compiler errors
    dynamic_ec.SomeMethod("some argument", 7, null);
    dynamic_ec.NonexistentMethod();
}
```

## Libraries
 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/807880/bcl-base-class-library-vs-fcl-framework-class-library
 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system?view=net-8.0
 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/class-library-overview

### Base Class Library (BCL): ###
The BCL contains fundamental types like System.String and System.DateTime.
It‚Äôs the foundation‚Äîbasic building blocks for .NET applications.

### Framework Class Library (FCL): ###
The FCL is broader‚Äîit includes the BCL.
Contains libraries for ASP.NET, WinForms, XML handling, ADO.NET, and more.
Developers use FCL classes to simplify their work.

### Runtime Libraries: ### 
These are part of the .NET runtime.
They provide essential functionality for executing .NET applications.
Think of them as the toolbox for developers.

**System namespace:**

The System namespace is the root namespace for fundamental types in .NET. This namespace includes classes that represent the base data types used by all applications, for example, Object (the root of the inheritance hierarchy), Byte, Char, Array, Int32, and String. Many of these types correspond to the primitive data types that your programming language uses. When you write code using .NET types, you can use your language's corresponding keyword when a .NET base data type is expected.

## Top Level Statement:
 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements

With top-level statements, you can avoid the extra ceremony of placing your program‚Äôs entry point in a static method within a class.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
```

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapGet("/hi", () => "Hello!");

app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
app.MapRazorPages();

app.Run();
```

</p>

**Compile Time:**

C#: C# (pronounced ‚ÄúC-sharp‚Äù) is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft. It‚Äôs commonly used for building Windows applications, web services, and more.

CIL (Common Intermediate Language): When you write C# code, it gets compiled into an intermediate language called CIL. Think of CIL as a platform-independent representation of your code. It‚Äôs similar to assembly language but at a higher level.

**.NET Framework:**

The .NET Framework is a set of libraries and tools provided by Microsoft. It includes a large collection of pre-built classes and functions that developers can use to build applications.
When you write C# code, you often rely on these .NET libraries to perform common tasks like file I/O, networking, and database access.

**Runtime:**

CLR (Common Language Runtime): The CLR is a crucial component of the .NET Framework. It takes the compiled CIL code and turns it into native machine code that your computer can execute directly.
The CLR also manages memory, handles exceptions, and provides other runtime services. It ensures that your C# application runs smoothly and efficiently.

## DLL EXE:

- DLL (Dynamic Link Library):
  
  A DLL is a shared library that contains reusable code, functions, and classes.
  
  It cannot be directly executed; instead, it needs a host executable (usually an EXE) to run.
  
  DLLs are designed for code reusability across multiple applications.
  
  When a DLL is loaded, it becomes part of the address space of an existing process.
  
  Common use cases for DLLs include utility functions, custom controls, and database access.
  
  The file format of DLLs and EXEs is essentially the same, but Windows distinguishes them through the PE (Portable Executable) header in the file.
  
  
- EXE (Executable):
  
  An EXE file is an independent executable program that runs in its own address space.
  
  It launches a separate application process.
  
  When you run an EXE, it typically starts a new process with its own memory space.
  
  EXEs are used for standalone applications, such as desktop applications or console programs.
  
  The entry point for an EXE is the main method or function.
  
  EXEs can be executed directly by the operating system.

## Attribute:

  Attributes provide a way to associate metadata or additional information with code elements. They allow me to add declarative information to classes, methods, properties, and other program entities.

  Attributes are a powerful way to add metadata and behavior to your code, and they play a crucial role in various scenarios such as serialization, validation, and more

  - Built-in Attributes:

    C# provides several built-in attributes that you can use directly.

    ```csharp
      [Serializable] // Marks a class as serializable
      public class SampleClass
      {
          // Class implementation...
      }
    ```
  - Creating Custom Attributes:
    
    You can also create your own custom attributes by defining a new class that inherits from the Attribute base class.
    
    Custom attributes allow you to add specific behavior or information to your code.

    ```csharp
      [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Method)]
      public class MyCustomAttribute : Attribute
      {
          public string Description { get; }
      
          public MyCustomAttribute(string description)
          {
              Description = description;
          }
      }
    ```
    
  - Applying Custom Attributes:
    
    To apply an attribute, use square brackets ([]) above the declaration of the entity (class, method, etc.) to which it applies.

    ```csharp
      [MyCustom("This is a custom attribute")]
      public class MyClass
      {
          // Class implementation...
      }

    ```
   - Retrieving Attribute Information at Runtime:

     You can retrieve attribute information programmatically using reflection.

     ```csharp
      var attribute = typeof(MyClass).GetCustomAttributes(typeof(MyCustomAttribute), false)
                                .FirstOrDefault() as MyCustomAttribute;
      if (attribute != null)
      {
          Console.WriteLine($"Description: {attribute.Description}");
      }

     ```

## Anonymous Types
 ### What are Anonymous Types?
  Anonymous types are nameless types that allow you to bundle a set of read-only properties into a single object without explicitly defining a type beforehand.
  These types are particularly useful when you want to create a temporary object with specific properties without having to create a formal class or struct.
  
  - Creating an Anonymous Type:
  To create an anonymous object, use the new keyword along with an object initializer (curly braces {}) to specify the desired properties.
  The compiler infers the type name, and you don‚Äôt need to explicitly declare it.
  
  Example:

  ```csharp
  var person = new { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };
  ```

 ### Usage Scenarios:
  Query Expressions: Anonymous types are commonly used in the select clause of LINQ query expressions to return a subset of properties from each object in a source sequence.
  Reducing Data: When querying data, using anonymous types allows you to return only the necessary properties, reducing the amount of data retrieved.
  Read-Only Properties: Anonymous types contain only public read-only properties. No other members (methods, events, etc.) are allowed.
  Property Initialization: You can initialize properties from other types. 
  
  For example:

  ```csharp
  var products = new List<Product>(); // Assume Product class has Color and Price properties
  var productQuery = from prod in products
                     select new { prod.Color, prod.Price };
  ```

Anonymous types are lightweight and convenient for short-lived scenarios.
They cannot contain functions, constructors, or other class members.
In summary, anonymous types provide a quick way to create small, temporary objects with specific properties. They‚Äôre especially handy when working with LINQ queries or when I need a simple data structure on the fly!

## Scoped Ref:

### What Is a Ref Struct?

A ref struct is a special type in C# that lives on the stack (rather than the heap) and is designed for performance-critical scenarios.
It‚Äôs often used for things like buffers, memory pools, or other low-level operations.

### The Problem with Passing Ref Structs

When you pass a ref struct as an argument to a method, there‚Äôs a concern about its lifetime.
If the method captures or returns the ref struct, it could lead to unexpected behavior because the lifetime of the ref struct isn‚Äôt guaranteed.

### Enter the Scoped Keyword

The scoped keyword was introduced in C# 11 to address this issue.
When you mark a ref struct parameter as scoped, it means that the method can accept a locally declared ref struct without capturing it or returning it.
In other words, the method won‚Äôt hold onto the ref struct beyond its own scope.

### Use Cases for Scoped Ref

Imagine you have a ref struct representing a buffer, and you want to pass it to a method for processing.
By using scoped, you ensure that the method won‚Äôt accidentally capture the buffer or return it, avoiding lifetime issues.

## Ref Struct:
### What is a ref struct?
A ref struct is a special type of structure (or struct) in C# that has some unique characteristics:

Instances of a ref struct are allocated on the stack rather than the managed heap.
They cannot escape to the managed heap, ensuring that they remain within the stack frame.
The purpose of ref struct is to allow types that can only exist on the stack, improving memory efficiency and performance.

### Why is it important?
**Memory Safety**: By restricting ref struct instances to the stack, C# ensures memory safety. These types cannot be accidentally moved to the heap, preventing potential memory leaks or unsafe behavior.

**Performance**: Since ref struct instances reside on the stack, they avoid the overhead of heap allocation and garbage collection. This makes them more efficient in terms of memory usage and access time.

**Span and ReadOnlySpan**: One of the most common use cases for ref struct is with Span<T> and ReadOnlySpan<T>. These types allow efficient manipulation of contiguous memory regions (e.g., arrays, buffers) without unnecessary copying. Both Span<T> and ReadOnlySpan<T> are implemented as ref struct types1.

**Stack-Only Behavior**: By using ref struct, you can enforce stack-only behavior for certain types. This is particularly useful when dealing with low-level memory operations or when you want to avoid heap allocations.

**Avoiding Heap Pressure**: When working with large datasets or performance-critical code, using ref struct can help reduce heap pressure and improve overall application performance.

Example: Defining a ref struct

```csharp
public ref struct CustomRef
{
    public bool IsValid;
    public Span<int> Inputs;
    public Span<int> Outputs;
}
```

Readonly ref struct

```csharp
public readonly ref struct ConversionRequest
{
    public ConversionRequest(double rate, ReadOnlySpan<double> values)
    {
        Rate = rate;
        Values = values;

## Primary Consturctors:
primary constructors were introduced in version 12. They provide a concise syntax for declaring constructors whose parameters are available throughout the body of a type.

**Declaration:**

1. Can add parameters to a class or struct declaration to create a primary constructor.
2. Primary constructor parameters are in scope throughout the class definition.
3. They are similar to method parameters but have specific rules.

**Rules for Primary Constructor Parameters:**

1. They may not be stored if not needed.
2. They aren‚Äôt members of the class.
3. They can be assigned to.
4. They don‚Äôt become properties (except in record types).

**Common Uses:**

1. As arguments to a base() constructor invocation.
2. To initialize member fields or properties.
3. Referencing them in instance members.

**Record Type with Primary Constructor**
```csharp
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);
```

**Class with Primary Constructor and Initialization**
```csharp
public class Point
{
    public double X { get; }
    public double Y { get; }

    public Point(double x, double y) => (X, Y) = (x, y);
}
```

**Struct with Primary Constructor and Computed Properties**
```csharp
public readonly struct Circle
{
    public double Radius { get; }
    public double Area => Math.PI * Radius * Radius;

    public Circle(double radius) => Radius = radius;
}
```

## AOT:
**Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation** in the context of C# refers to a process where C# code is compiled to native machine code before the application runs.

**Purpose:**

AOT compilation contrasts with the traditional method where code is compiled to native code during runtime (Just-In-Time compilation, or JIT).
AOT aims to improve startup time and reduce memory overhead.

**How It Works:**

During AOT, the C# code is compiled to native machine code on the developer‚Äôs machine.
The resulting native binary can run directly without relying on a JIT compiler during execution.

**Benefits:**

Faster Startup: AOT-compiled apps start more quickly because there‚Äôs no JIT compilation delay.
Smaller Memory Footprint: Native binaries are often smaller than their JIT-compiled counterparts.
Restricted Environments: AOT apps can run in environments where JIT compilation isn‚Äôt allowed.

**Limitations:**
AOT support varies across different versions of .NET.
Not all libraries are fully compatible with AOT.
Some platform-specific limitations exist.

## Class vs Struct:
### Reference Types (Classes):
**Lives on the heap**: Objects of reference types (instances of classes) are allocated on the heap.

**Contains a reference**: A variable of a reference type holds a reference (or pointer) to the actual data stored elsewhere in memory.

**Nullable**: Reference types can be null.

**Used for complex scenarios**: Classes are suitable for more complex data structures, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Can have default constructors and destructors.

### Value Types (Structs):
**Lives inline:** Structs are value types, and their instances are stored directly where the variable or field is defined (usually on the stack).

**Contains the entire value**: A variable of a value type contains the entire value type value.

**Non-nullable**: Value types cannot be null.

**Used for lightweight data**: Structs are ideal for small, lightweight data structures (e.g., coordinates, simple data).
Cannot have default constructors or destructors

## Glossaries:

1. Buffer: a sequence of bytes in memory
2. Buffering: manipulation of that data
3. Primitive Types: the most basic data types that the language supports and the compiler predefines
4. Offset: integer that represents the distance between the beginning of an array or data structure object and a specific point or element
