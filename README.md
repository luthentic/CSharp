## ⭐CLR(Common Language Runtime) / CIL(Common Intermediate Language)
**Compile Time:**

C#: C# (pronounced “C-sharp”) is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft. It’s commonly used for building Windows applications, web services, and more.

CIL (Common Intermediate Language): When you write C# code, it gets compiled into an intermediate language called CIL. Think of CIL as a platform-independent representation of your code. It’s similar to assembly language but at a higher level.

**.NET Framework:**

The .NET Framework is a set of libraries and tools provided by Microsoft. It includes a large collection of pre-built classes and functions that developers can use to build applications.

When you write C# code, you often rely on these .NET libraries to perform common tasks like file I/O, networking, and database access.

**Runtime:**

CLR (Common Language Runtime): The CLR is a crucial component of the .NET Framework. It takes the compiled CIL code and turns it into native machine code that your computer can execute directly.

The CLR also manages memory, handles exceptions, and provides other runtime services. It ensures that your C# application runs smoothly and efficiently.
